\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The aim of this project was to demonstrate that an existing Matlab-based
package for implementing thousands of time-series analysis methods,
\href{https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa}{hctsa}
(\url{https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa}), could be extended to a
python-based implementation, for potential future inclusion into
\href{http://nipy.org/nitime/}{Nitime} (\url{http://nipy.org/nitime/}).

Recent work has contributed a comprehensive library of over 35,000
pieces of diverse time-series data, and over 7,000 unique structural
features extracted from hundreds of different time-series analysis
methods \cite{Fulcher2013}, which can be explored through an associated
\href{www.comp-engine.org/timeseries}{website}
(\url{www.comp-engine.org/timeseries}) and implemented using the
Matlab-based code package,
\href{https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa}{hctsa}. The \emph{hctsa}
software provides a systematic, algorithmic platform for computing a
wide range of structural properties from a single time series, including
basic statistics of the distribution, linear correlation structure,
stationarity, information theoretic and entropy measures, methods from
the physical nonlinear time-series analysis literature, linear and
nonlinear model fits, and others. Thus, hctsa can be used to map a time
series to a comprehensive vector of interpretable structural features
and these features can then be systematically compared to determine and
understand the most useful features for a given scientific objective
(e.g., features of an EEG signal that help classify different patient
groups).

In order to apply highly comparative time-series analysis in the
neuroscience community, it would be desirable to implement some
time-series analysis methods into
\href{http://nipy.org/nitime/}{Nitime}, a python-based software package
for performing time-series analysis on neuroscience data. Implementation
of useful time-series features into python, and potential integration
with Nitime, would not only facilitate their use by the neuroscience
community, but also their maintenance and development within an open
source framework.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

An illustration of the approach is shown in Fig. \ref{centfig}. Each
time series is converted to a vector of thousands of informative
features using the \emph{hctsa} package; machine learning methods can
then be used to determine the most useful features (e.g., that best
discriminate patient groups, and where in the brain the best
discrimination occurs). In this project, we wanted to demonstrate a
feasible pathway for incorporating these useful features into the Nitime
package.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \includegraphics[width=.47\textwidth]{nitime.png}
  \caption{\label{centfig} Illustration of the highly comparative approach to time-series data from neuroscience.}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}\label{results}

I successfully implemented a handful of basic time-series analysis
functions from Matlab into python using partials, with full support for
vectors of data stored in numpy arrays, and basic support for the Nitime
data format (extracting the data vector from the Nitime TimeSeries class
for evenly sampled data). This proof-of-principle is
\href{https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa_python}{here}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

Our results demonstrate that time-series analysis methods, discovered
using the \href{https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa}{hctsa package}, can
be implemented natively in python in a systematic way, with basic
support for the time-series format used in Nitime. This will help
facilitate future work on time-series analysis to be incorporated
straightforwardly into this open source environment. Although there are
no plans to reimplement the full \emph{hctsa} feature library in python,
our hope is that published work describing useful time-series features
(discovered using the \emph{hctsa} library) can also contribute a python
implementation, to promote its use by the neuroscience community.
